# Heartbeat Checklist

Keep this under 20 lines. The heartbeat's job is to notice things, not do things.

- [ ] Check for unread priority emails
- [ ] Review calendar for upcoming events (next 4 hours)
- [ ] Check active-tasks.md — flag anything stale (>24h with no update)
- [ ] Verify running services are healthy (if applicable)
- [ ] Check for messages that need follow-up

If something needs deep work, log it to daily notes and alert the user.
Reply HEARTBEAT_OK if nothing needs attention.
